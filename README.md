# From 0 to React
The purpose of this repo is to get you a bit of exposure to React before we cover it in detail
in the main course. It starts out by talking about CDN, the gradually introduces NPM before culminating
in having you implement a small React app. It aims to get you there in 3 steps:

1. JavaScript Libraries
    - CDNs
    - NPM
2. NPM and the Web
    - imports and exports
    - bundling apps with Parcel
3. React
    - setting up a project from scratch
    - props
    - state management
    - event handling
    - forms
    - iterating and the `key` prop

## How to use this repo
Fork this repo, make sure to *uncheck* the box that says "Copy the `main` branch only". If you do 
check it, you *won't* get access to the solution branches.

Each step of this project has a corresponding directory (`./step_1`, `./step_2`, etc). Your job
is to read the `README.md` inside of each step and complete the steps listed.

## Requirements
In order to complete this project, you'll need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed first.
You should have installed that at the beginning of the course during machine set up. You can double-check
that things are installed correctly by running the following command from a terminal:
```npm --version```.

The particular version doesn't really matter, but be sure that the terminal doesn't complain about the 
command not being found. *If you're on windows, make sure you're running the command inside of a WSL shell,
or if you don't have that installed a "Git for Bash" shell. On Mac OS and Linux, any shell should do fine.


## Get Going!
Now, head on over to [Step 1](./step_1/README.md) and start hacking!
